# SkillForge-VR  

**SkillForge-VR** is an immersive, AI-powered **PCVR (PC-based Virtual Reality)** application designed to revolutionize **Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET)** in Nigeria and beyond.  

This demo is part of the **IEEE Metaverse Competition** to demonstrate the integration of **AI in vocational education**.  

---

## 🚩 Problem  

- **Limited access for beginners** due to the complex user interfaces of existing VR training systems.  
- Traditional vocational training in Nigeria is often **static, language-limited, and difficult to scale**.  
- Learners face challenges bridging theory with hands-on practice.  
- The formal system struggles to accommodate **diverse learning paces** and individual learning patterns.  
- Language barriers hinder access, as most training is not delivered in **local languages (Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba)**, unlike real-life workshops where learners often use their mother tongue.  

---

## 💡 Solution  

**SkillForge-VR** addresses these challenges by combining **AI-driven adaptive learning** with **immersive VR environments**:  

- **PCVR Support** → optimized for PC-based VR headsets, enabling high-quality and scalable experiences.  
- **Voice-first Interaction (VUI)** → makes VR learning natural, intuitive, and beginner-friendly.  
- **Adaptive AI Tutors** → adjust difficulty, intensity, and learning paths based on real-time user feedback.  
- **Career Guidance Lobby** → users interact with an **AI Career Mentor** that matches passions to specific TVET sub-fields.  
- **Workshop Simulations** → users enter VR workshops (e.g., carpentry, welding, tailoring, mechanics) and are guided by an **AI Instructor** that provides tasks, feedback, and hands-on simulations.  
- **Multilingual Support** → Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba for inclusivity and accessibility.  
- **Gamification** → challenges, rewards, and progress tracking keep users engaged.  
- **For All Ages** → designed to support **children and adults**, lowering the barrier for anyone interested in vocational skills.

## 🛠 Workflow  

1. **VR Lobby** – user enters a central hub.  
   - Option 1: **AI Career Guide** → speak with a mentor, receive tailored career path suggestions.  
   - Option 2: **Workshops** → select a vocational trade to learn.  

2. **AI Career Guide**  
   - Conversation with an **AI Mentor** about passions and goals.  
   - AI recommends the best-suited TVET field.
   - User and AI discuss Trade-offs, Market Demand, and Personal Goals.

3. **Workshop Learning**  
   - Enter a workshop (e.g., electrical, mechanical, tailoring).  
   - AI Instructor assigns tasks, guides step-by-step, and adjusts based on performance.  
   - Adaptive learning ensures **progressive mastery** rather than static repetition.  

4. **Feedback & Progress**  
   - AI monitors interactions, adapts to user’s learning style.  
   - Progression is gamified → unlocking new levels and certifications.

## 📷 User Testing  

We conducted **initial user testing** to validate the approach. Early results show that:  

- Beginners found the **voice-first interface easier** than traditional VR menus.  
- Both children and adults quickly adapted to the **task-driven learning style**.  
- Users felt **more engaged** when AI adjusted the challenge dynamically.
